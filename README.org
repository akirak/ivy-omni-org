This is an Emacs package which lets you access Org buffers, Org files,
 Org bookmarks, and custom org-agenda commands via a single Ivy interface. This is analogous to
=ivy-switch-buffer= with virtual buffers enabled.

Note: [[https://github.com/casouri/ivy-filthy-rich][ivy-filthy-rich]] is used to decorate buffer entries in this screenshot.

** Prerequisites
- Emacs 25.1
- ivy
- dash
** Configuration
See [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d/blob/master/setup/setup-ivy-omni-org.el][my config]] for a comprehensive example of configuration.
*** Entry types
To configure the types (and the order) of contents displayed in =ivy-omni-org= command, customize =ivy-omni-org-content-types= variable.
Its default value is ='(buffers files agenda-commands bookmarks)=.
*** File sources
To configure the list of files, set =ivy-omni-org-file-sources= variable:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ivy-omni-org-file-sources '(org-agenda-files))
#+end_src

=ivy-omni-org-file-sources= variable is a list of symbols, and each symbol in the list can be either a function returning a list of files or a variable containing a list of files.

If you are using [[https://github.com/akirak/org-starter][org-starter]] package, the following setting is recomended:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ivy-omni-org-file-sources '(org-starter-known-files))
#+end_src
*** Custom entry types and reordering the sections
By customizing =ivy-omni-org-custom-content-types=, you can display user-defined contents in =ivy-omni-org=.

An example integration is with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]], which is included in the package out of the box. That is, it lists =org-ql-views= defined within the package.
** Usage
Run =ivy-omni-org= command.
** To-Dos
- [X] Add an action to visit the entry in other window
- [ ] Add an action to kill the selected buffer
- [ ] Add an action to create an entry or fire =org-capture=
