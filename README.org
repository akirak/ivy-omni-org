*Deprecation notice*: This package is currently not maintained. Unless you have a specific reason for using this package, I'd recommend you use consult, marginalia, and embark.

This is an Emacs package which lets you access Org buffers, Org files,
 Org bookmarks, and custom org-agenda commands via a single Ivy interface. This is analogous to
=ivy-switch-buffer= with virtual buffers enabled.

Note: [[https://github.com/casouri/ivy-filthy-rich][ivy-filthy-rich]] is used to decorate buffer entries in this screenshot.

** Prerequisites
- Emacs 25.1
- ivy
- dash
** Configuration
See [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d/blob/master/setup/setup-ivy-omni-org.el][my config]] for a comprehensive example of configuration.
*** Entry types
To configure the types (and the order) of contents displayed in =ivy-omni-org= command, customize =ivy-omni-org-content-types= variable.
Its default value is ='(buffers files agenda-commands bookmarks)=.
*** File sources
To configure the list of files, set =ivy-omni-org-file-sources= variable:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ivy-omni-org-file-sources '(org-agenda-files))
#+end_src

=ivy-omni-org-file-sources= variable is a list of symbols, and each symbol in the list can be either a function returning a list of files or a variable containing a list of files.

If you are using [[https://github.com/akirak/org-starter][org-starter]] package, the following setting is recomended:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ivy-omni-org-file-sources '(org-starter-known-files))
#+end_src
*** Custom entry types and reordering the sections
By customizing =ivy-omni-org-custom-content-types=, you can display user-defined contents in =ivy-omni-org=.

An example integration is with [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]], which is included in the package out of the box. That is, it lists =org-ql-views= defined within the package.
** Usage
Run =ivy-omni-org= command.
** To-Dos
- [X] Add an action to visit the entry in other window
- [ ] Add an action to kill the selected buffer
- [ ] Add an action to create an entry or fire =org-capture=
** Change log
*** 0.2.2 (2020-01-25)
- *Add* a command =ivy-omni-org-bookmarks= which displays only a list of bookmarks.
- *Add* a custom variable =ivy-omni-org-prepend-entry-type=, which allows you to not prepending an entry type to each entry.
- *Add* an argument to =ivy-omni-org= function =:types=, which lets you limit only certain types of entries.
  - When a single type is displayed, the entry type is not prepended.
